    Tutorial | Kernel | Description
-|:-:|-
[Getting Started with RTL Kernels](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/blob/master/docs/getting-started-rtl-kernels/README.md){:target="_blank"} | RTL | This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Vitis core development kit to program an RTL kernel into an FPGA and build a Hardware Emulation using a common development flow.
[Vitis HLS Analysis and Optimization](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/blob/master/docs/vitis_hls_analysis/README.md){:target="_blank"} | C | This tutorial demonstrates how you can use the Vitis HLS tool GUI to build, analyze, and optimize a hardware kernel.
[Mixing C and RTL](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/blob/master/docs/mixing-c-rtl-kernels/README.md){:target="_blank"} | C and RTL | This tutorial demonstrates working with an application containing RTL and OpenCL™ kernels to familiarize yourself with the Vitis core development kit flow, along with various design analysis features.
[Using Multiple Compute Units](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/blob/master/docs/using-multiple-cu/README.md){:target="_blank"} | C and RTL | This tutorial demonstrates the flexible kernel linking process to increase the number of kernel instances on an FPGA, which improves the parallelism in a combined host-kernel system.
[Host Code Optimization](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/blob/master/docs/host-code-opt/README.md){:target="_blank"} | C and RTL | This tutorial demonstrates applying host code optimization techniques to your design.
[Using Multiple DDR Banks](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/blob/master/docs/mult-ddr-banks/README.md){:target="_blank"} | C and RTL | This tutorial demonstrates how using multiple DDRs can improve data transfer between kernels and global memory.
